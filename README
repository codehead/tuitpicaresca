TwitPanto
=========

If you want to reuse this code for another panto, you'll probably need to do
some or all of the following:

e stream/stream.php will need updating with a Twitter username and password,
  and the correct hashtag. This script needs to start running before the panto,
  and never stop. It will output everything to disc, like magic. The front end
  pulls from the static file it's outputting every few seconds - you could end
  up using quite a bit of bandwidth.

* To allow Twitter posting from the site:
  1. Set up a Twitter app with "Browser" application type, and a callback URL
     of wherever your site is /callback.php
  2. Copy config.php-example to config.php and fill in the appropriate values.

* index.html is a symlink to whichever of index_pre/live/post is currently
  needed - pre in the days before the panto, live at some point on the day of
  the panto, and post afterwards when you've created the static transcript. The
  text in all the index files will need updating for cast list etc.

* The JS in js/twitpanto-live.js will need the cast list, date and hashtag
  updating at the least, as will similar data in twitpanto-pre.js.

* The twitpanto.ics iCal file will need updating.

Plus of course changing the CSS, images, and so on, if you want.

Post panto:

* index_post.html will need most of the text removing and replacing with the
  output of stream/make_html (updated with correct data) from the JSON
  generated during the panto (tidied up a bit if you want - e.g. for Twitpanto
  2010 I removed the top 20 or so lines from all.json to start at an
  appropriate place).

* js/twitpanto-post.js will need updating to have the correct values for the
  front end to work.

Sorry this isn't much documentation, and it was all cobbled together, but it's
better than nothing and worked well on the day.

ATB,
Matthew
